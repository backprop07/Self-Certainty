            "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To find the area of pentagon $CMJKN$, we can break it down into smaller shapes. First, we can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$ using Heron's formula. The semiperimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $s = \\frac{13 + 12 + 5}{2} = 15$. Using Heron's formula, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{s(s-13)(s-12)(s-5)} = \\sqrt{15 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 10} = \\sqrt{900} = 30$.\n\nWe can then find the area of $\\triangle AMC$ and $\\triangle ANC$ using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. Since $CM = CN = 4$, the area of $\\triangle AMC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 10$ and the area of $\\triangle ANC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 7 = 14$.\n\nWe can also find the area of $\\triangle AMB$ and $\\triangle ANC$ using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of $\\triangle AMB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = 18$.\n\nThe area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ minus the area of $\\triangle AMC$ minus the area of $\\triangle ANC$ plus the area of $\\triangle AMB$ minus the area of $\\triangle JMB$. We can find the area of $\\triangle JMB$ using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of $\\triangle JMB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot 4.84 = 18.36$.\n\nTherefore, the area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is $30 - 10 - 14 + 18 - 18.36 = 5.64$. However, this is not a common fraction. We can simplify the area of $\\triangle JMB$ to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot 4.84 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{122}{25} = \\frac{1098}{25}$.\n\nThe area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is $30 - 10 - 14 + 18 - \\frac{1098}{25} = \\frac{600}{25} - \\frac{250}{25} - \\frac{350}{25} + \\frac{450}{25} - \\frac{1098}{25} = -\\frac{548}{25}$. However, this is a negative area. This is not possible, so we must re-examine our calculations.\n\nUpon re-examining our calculations, we notice that the area of $\\triangle JMB$ is actually $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot 4.84 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{122}{25} = \\frac{1098}{25}$. However, we can also find the area of $\\triangle JMB$ using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area of $\\triangle JMB$ is also equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot (5 - x)$, where $x$ is the length of $MJ$. Since $MJ$ is the altitude of $\\triangle AMB$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the length of $MJ$. The area of $\\triangle AMB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = 18$, and the area of $\\triangle JMB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot (5 - x)$. We can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 9 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot (5 - x)$ and solve for $x$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{18}{4} = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n\nThe area of $\\triangle JMB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot (5 - \\frac{9}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nThe area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ minus the area of $\\triangle AMC$ minus the area of $\\triangle ANC$ plus the area of $\\triangle AMB$ minus the area of $\\triangle JMB$. Therefore, the area of pentagon $CMJKN$ is $30 - 10 - 14 + 18 - \\frac{9}{4} = 24 - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{96}{4} - \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{87}{4}.$\",\n    \"answer\": \"\\frac{87}{4}\"\n}",

We denote this altitude as AH. \n\nWe can see that triangle AHC is a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 4, so its area is (1/2)(5)(4) = 10.\n\nSince triangle ABH is also a right triangle with legs of length 13 and 4, its area is (1/2)(13)(4) = 26.\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles AHC and ABH, which is 10 + 26 = 36.\n\nNow, we can see that the area of triangle AMB is half the area of triangle ABC, which is (1/2)(36) = 18.\n\nThe area of triangle MJN is half the area of triangle AMB, which is (1/2)(18) = 9.\n\nWe can see that the area of triangle CMJN is the area of triangle MJN plus the area of triangle AHC minus the area of triangle CMH.\n\nThe area of triangle CMH is (1/2)(4)(4) = 8.\n\nSo, the area of triangle CMJN is 9 + 10 - 8 = 11.\n\nThe area of pentagon CMJKN is the area of triangle CMJN plus the area of triangle CNK.\n\nWe can see that the area of triangle CNK is half the area of triangle ABN, which is half the area of triangle ABC minus the area of triangle AMB.\n\nThe area of triangle ABN is 36 - 18 = 18.\n\nThe area of triangle CNK is (1/2)(18) = 9.\n\nThe area of pentagon CMJKN is 11 + 9 = 20.\",\n    \"answer\": \"20\"\n}"

            "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To find the area of the hexagonal region, we can divide it into two congruent trapezoids and a rectangle. Each trapezoid has a base of length $AB$ and a height of $AB\\sqrt2$, while the rectangle has a length of $AB$ and a width of $AB\\sqrt2$. The area of the trapezoids is $\\frac{1}{2}(AB + AB\\sqrt2) \\times AB\\sqrt2 = \\frac{1}{2}AB(AB + AB\\sqrt2)$ and the area of the rectangle is $AB \\times AB\\sqrt2 = AB^2\\sqrt2$. Therefore, the total area of the hexagon is $2(\\frac{1}{2}AB(AB + AB\\sqrt2)) + AB^2\\sqrt2 = AB^2 + AB^2\\sqrt2 + AB^2\\sqrt2 = AB^2(1 + 2\\sqrt2)$. We are given that the area of the hexagonal region is $2116(\\sqrt2+1)$, so we can set up the equation $AB^2(1 + 2\\sqrt2) = 2116(\\sqrt2+1)$ and solve for $AB$. Dividing both sides by $1 + 2\\sqrt2$, we get $AB^2 = \\frac{2116(\\sqrt2+1)}{1 + 2\\sqrt2}$. To simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $1 - 2\\sqrt2$. This gives us $AB^2 = \\frac{2116(\\sqrt2+1)(1 - 2\\sqrt2)}{(1 + 2\\sqrt2)(1 - 2\\sqrt2)} = \\frac{2116(\\sqrt2+1 - 2\\sqrt2 - 2)}{1 - 8} = \\frac{2116(-1 + \\sqrt2)}{-7} = \\frac{2116(1 - \\sqrt2)}{7} = \\frac{2116 - 2116\\sqrt2}{7}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB = \\sqrt{\\frac{2116 - 2116\\sqrt2}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4(529 - 529\\sqrt2)}{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4(529 - 529\\sqrt2)}{7}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt7}\\sqrt{529 - 529\\sqrt2}$. To simplify the expression further, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt7$, giving us $AB = \\frac{2\\sqrt7}{7}\\sqrt{529 - 529\\sqrt2}$. We can simplify the expression inside the square root by factoring out $529$ and using the difference of squares formula: $\\sqrt{529 - 529\\sqrt2} = \\sqrt{529(1 - \\sqrt2)} = \\sqrt{529} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\sqrt2} = 23\\sqrt{1 - \\sqrt2}$.
